            {/*<p>MUN's history traces back to the United Nations itself. Founded in 1945 just after the end of World War II,
                the UN replaced its predecessor, the League of Nations, and pledged to help create international peace, 
                cooperation, and security to avoid a third world war from occurring. It also works to uphold international law,
                protect human rights, deliver aid to those who need it, and promote sustainable development.
                In order to accomplish these daunting task, the UN created several internal committees, such as the General 
                Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council, International Court of Justice, as well as a number 
                of funds and programs to aid the needy. Each committee has their own topics to focus on and discuss. For example,
                the General Assembly focuses on UN budgets, admission of new member states, and questions involving peace and 
                security, while the Security Council focuses on pressing issues that compromise security, such as international 
                disputes.

                MUN is not an organization, like the UN. It first surfaced as a student-run Model League of Nations in the 1920s, 
                since the League of Nations was the predecessor of the UN and when the UN was formed, the MUN era exploded. 
                Student-run conferences began appearing all over the world. The first MUN conference that emerged was Berkeley
                Model United Nations and Harvard Model United Nations soon followed. Now high school students can participate in
                Model UN conferences anywhere in the world to improve their public speaking, create solutions to pressing world
                issues, and have fun.
